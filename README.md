NOTES:

1. While `hm` does support installing software, it's worth mentioning that the
   tools needed to install the software using the INSTALL instructions should
   be installed and handled by the user. `hm` won't install `cargo-binstall` for
   example (unless you specifically tell it to do so via some other INSTALL instruction).
2. If at any point installation fails, the whole program doesn't crash and continues working
   on copying the rest of the configs and managing other installations.
