NOTES:

1. While `hm` does support installing software, it's worth mentioning that the
   tools needed to install the software using the INSTALL instructions should
   be installed and handled by the user. `hm` won't install `cargo-binstall` for
   example (unless you specifically tell it to do so via some other INSTALL instruction).
